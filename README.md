fundamentals of tennis graph

This is a simple graph I made while coaching highschool tennis. It is meant to be a basic breakdown of some of the fundamentals of tennis. 

Each node also links to a YouTube Playlist. Some are filled with videos, and some are completely empty. I was building this up while coaching, so I was mainly focusing on 
the areas the players were struggling with. At its core, I believe it is easier to get ahead in tennis (up around D1/D2 level) by primarily focusing on strategy and the mental
aspects of the sport. That being said, there are only a handful of fundamental strategy concepts that need to be understood to get the majority of the benefits. 
That leads to the strategy playlists having only a few videos each. These are typically longer videos, but a strong grasp of their content will go a long way.

The most filled playlists will be the common struggle points like serves, volleys, forehands, and backhands. All of the videos say pretty much the same thing in a slightly
different way. Some will even provide drills to practice. I've tried to keep them mainly to the fundamental concepts rather than getting bogged down in fine-tuning a stroke.

The least filled are the physical nodes. I'm not the healthiest person, and I was near the bottom of the athletic totem pole while I was a player. This is not my area of expertise, 
and it wasn't an area where the players I was coaching really struggled with. Feel free to shoot videos my way though, and I will get them added!
